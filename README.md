# Creating a website with Astro JS and Wordpress

In this example, I use the [Astro JS](https://astro.build/) framework and Wordpress to create a website. I use the `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts` API to retrieve the information I need.

I also created a script to remove HTML tags from `post.excerpt.rendered` and another one to format the date.

The possibilities are endless!
